## **5\. Core Gameplay Loop**

*(Describe the main actions the player will repeat. What's the fundamental cycle of play?)*

1. **Build & Customize:** Player designs the lake layout, adds environmental elements (trees, rocks using simple geometric forms).  
2. **Stock Fish:** Player purchases different fish species to populate the lake.  
3. **Manage Resources:** Player monitors fish populations (reproduction vs. fishing by visitors) and manages finances.  
4. **Attract Visitors:** Visitors come to fish, generating income based on available amenities.  
5. **Invest & Expand:** Player uses earnings to buy more/better fish, add structures (feeders, restaurants, gear rental, rest areas), and upgrade existing facilities.  
6. **Unlock & Progress:** Player unlocks new fish species, structures, and upgrades as their "pesque e pague" grows and becomes more profitable.  
7. **Repeat:** Continuously improve and expand the business.

## **6\. Key Features**

*(List 3-5 main features that define your game. What are the most important mechanics or elements?)*

* **Lake Customization:** Design the physical layout using simple geometric shapes for terrain, trees, rocks, and water features.  
* **Fish Species Management:** Buy various fish, manage their reproduction rates, and balance stock against visitor fishing. Rarer/more valuable fish generate more income when caught by a visitor, but might be harder to catch, encouraging players to build fishing gear rental facilities.  
* **Structure Building:** Place and upgrade various buildings like automatic feeders, visitor rest areas, restaurants, bars, and fishing gear rental shops. Each structure contributes to visitor satisfaction or income generation.  
* **Visitor Economy:** Visitors arrive and fish. Each visitor generates a base income, plus bonuses based on the amenities available (e.g., if there's a restaurant, each visitor pays a bit more).  
* **Progression System:** Unlock new fish, structures, and upgrades by reaching certain milestones or earning enough money, allowing for continuous expansion.

## **7\. Platform(s)**

*(Where will the game be playable?)*  
Web Browser (HTML5)

## **8\. Art Style / Theme**

*(Describe the visual and auditory style. What is the overall mood and setting?)*

* **Theme:** Brazilian "pesque e pague" (fish and pay park), vibrant, relaxing, and welcoming.  
* **Art Style:** Simple and colorful, made of geometric forms. Likely a top-down or slightly isometric perspective to allow for easy placement and viewing of the lake and structures.  
* **Sound:** Relaxing Brazilian music (e.g., Bossa Nova, Samba de Roda instrumentals), ambient nature sounds (birds chirping, water flowing), and gentle sound effects like fishing line splashes, fish caught, and subtle visitor chatter.

## **9\. Monetization (if any)**

*(How will the game generate revenue, if applicable? This is for you, the developer, not just in-game money.)*  
None planned at this stage. The focus is on creating a complete and enjoyable gameplay experience.

## **12\. Win/Loss Conditions**

*(How does a player win or lose the game, or a level within the game?)*
